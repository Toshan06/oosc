# Intelligent Video Environment & Item Detection  

This project uses **YOLOv8** for analyzing a video, detecting objects across frames, and classifying the type of environment (Home, Shop, Office, or Unknown).  

Detected objects are tracked uniquely, counted, and saved into a structured **JSON report**.
